An unmanned UAS flew the fire and captured infrared images indicating areas of heat. On 7/14, all resources will demobilize from the fire and the fire will remain in monitor status. Fire size decreased to 332 acres due to more accurate mapping.\"\\n6,Zone surveillance aircraft N222ME flew the area of the fire but was unable to observe it due to heavy smoke.\\n7,The fire was demobilized and placed into monitor status.\\n9,Zone surveillance aircraft N222ME flew the fire and reported it with a 10 percent active perimeter. The fire behavior was described as smoldering in a spruce/hardwood/brush mix. Observations were taken under 40 percent cloud cover.\\n11,\"The fire was flown by zone aircraft N22ME. No smoke, growth or active perimeter was reported.\"\\n12,\"Zone aircraft N222ME flew the fire and reported a 5 percent active perimeter, smoldering and creeping.  Personnel on board identified the largest amount activity on the southeast corner.  The fire remains west of Ammerman Creek and north of the Old Crow River.\"\\n15,\"Two recon flights were conducted over fire 231, neither found smoke. Personnel took approximately four tons of equipment and supplies off the fire by helicopter and ground. None of the connected suppression equipment was dismantled or taken off the fire.\"\\n20,\"Fire is contained and controlled, and will be placed into monitor status.\"\\n21,At 1545 zone surveillance aircraft N222ME flew reconnaissance over the fire. No smokes and no active perimeter were observed.\\n22,Increase in acreage matches latest perimeter.\\n23,At 1500 the fire was flown by zone surveillance aircraft N222ME. The fire was 25 percent active and was spreading to the north. Observed fire behavior included backing and torching in black spruce with 10 foot flame lengths. Weather observed included wind out of the north at 10 mph with 10 percent cloud cover and no precipitation.  Fire is most active on the SW edge.  A 12 mile line of fire has burned 2.10 miles south of the Salmon Trout allotment.   Resources on scene of the allotment and cabin continued to monitor weather and fuel conditions in preparation for a burnout operation. Higher relative humidities kept fuels damp and no burn was attempted. The Midnight Sun IHC began to pretreat areas around the allotment with water.  Tommorow personnel will continue monitoring conditions. A helicopter reconnaissance flight has been scheduled for tomorrow (7/14).\\n27,Zone surveillance aircraft N222ME flew the fire and reported it with a 30 percent active perimeter and spreading to the north. The fire was creeping and backing with isolated torching in black spruce. Observations were taken under 30 percent cloud cover with calm winds.   Personnel on the ground continued to improve upon the saw line around the allotment. An UAS (unmanned aircraft system) was launched and performed a recon over the fire.\\n30,The fire was flown by 904AK.  Personnel observed no activity and the fire remains in monitor status.\\n36,The fire was flown by 904AK.  Personnel observed no activity and the fire remains in monitor status.\\n37,The fire was flown by surveillance aircraft N222ME. Fire 312 has consumed fire 303.\\n39,The fire was flown by surveillance aircraft N222ME. The fire area was too smokey to make observations. New fire size result of update imaging.\\n43,Personnel began backhauling structure protection equipment.\\n46,\"The fire was discovered by zone aircraft N222ME during a detection flight. Personnel on board reported a 1 acre fire, 100 percent active, burning on flat terrain in black spruce. The fire plotted in a Limited suppression area and no values at risk were identified. The Upper Yukon Zone will continue to monitor this fire with aerial resources.\"\\n47,A small column of smoke was reported to the duty officer around 22:30 on 7/12 by a resident on Sand Lake.  Helitack responded after the fog and mist lifted on 7/13.  The reporter could no longer see any smoke once helitack was launched.  Helicopter 873HL thoroughly scanned the area and did not find any blackened ground or smoke.  It is planned to search the area on 7/14 when the weather is forecasted to be warmer and clearer.\\n49,\"Zone aircraft N222ME flew the fire and reported a 10 percent active perimeter.  Active burning was observed on the NE, NW and SE corners of the fire.  The fire continues to burn north of the Colleen River and west of Lois Creek.  Increase in acres reflects newer perimeter data.\"\\n51,\"Resources are facing a very active fire while protecting a cabin and 2 allotments.  Eight smokejumpers have been placed on the eastern portion of the allotments and are planning to burn out the area either late tonight or in the morning. The remaining 8 smokejumpers are prepping the rest of the allotments with hose lay and plumbing.  Zone aircraft H-361EH assisted the fire with supplies and bucket drops while N864SF assisted the smokejumpers on the ground with aerial observations and updates of the fire activity.  Depending on the success of the burnout operations, the fire could be mopped up within a few days time.\"\\n52,The fire was flown by 904AK.  Personnel observed no activity and the fire remains in monitor status.\\n55,\"Zone surveillance in aircraft N222ME flew the fire and reported a 5 percent active perimeter, smoldering along the ridgetop. No additional growth was visible. The fire remained 2.15 miles northeast of a National Park Service cabin. Decrease in acreage due to more accurate mapping.\"\\n58,Identified areas of growth using Landsat 8 image acquired 7/11 @ 2300.  Updated size to 3130 acres.\\n59,Zone surveillance in aircraft N309VS flew the fire and reported no active perimeter. The western interior of the fire was smoldering.\\n61,Fire was flown by zone detection aircraft N222ME and no visible smoke or active perimeter was observed.

      "23,At 1500 the fire was flown by zone surveillance aircraft N222ME. The fire was 25 percent active and was spreading to the north. Observed fire behavior included backing and torching in black spruce with 10 foot flame lengths. Weather observed included wind out of the north at 10 mph with 10 percent cloud cover and no precipitation.  Fire is most active on the SW edge.  A 12 mile line of fire has burned 2.10 miles south of the Salmon Trout allotment.   Resources on scene of the allotment and cabin continued to monitor weather and fuel conditions in preparation for a burnout operation. Higher relative humidities kept fuels damp and no burn was attempted. The Midnight Sun IHC began to pretreat areas around the allotment with water.  Tommorow personnel will continue monitoring conditions. A helicopter reconnaissance flight has been scheduled for tomorrow (7/14).\n",
      "27,Zone surveillance aircraft N222ME flew the fire and reported it with a 30 percent active perimeter and spreading to the north. The fire was creeping and backing with isolated torching in black spruce. Observations were taken under 30 percent cloud cover with calm winds.   Personnel on the ground continued to improve upon the saw line around the allotment. An UAS (unmanned aircraft system) was launched and performed a recon over the fire.\n",

      "46,\"The fire was discovered by zone aircraft N222ME during a detection flight. Personnel on board reported a 1 acre fire, 100 percent active, burning on flat terrain in black spruce. The fire plotted in a Limited suppression area and no values at risk were identified. The Upper Yukon Zone will continue to monitor this fire with aerial resources.\"\n",
      "47,A small column of smoke was reported to the duty officer around 22:30 on 7/12 by a resident on Sand Lake.  Helitack responded after the fog and mist lifted on 7/13.  The reporter could no longer see any smoke once helitack was launched.  Helicopter 873HL thoroughly scanned the area and did not find any blackened ground or smoke.  It is planned to search the area on 7/14 when the weather is forecasted to be warmer and clearer.\n",
      "49,\"Zone aircraft N222ME flew the fire and reported a 10 percent active perimeter.  Active burning was observed on the NE, NW and SE corners of the fire.  The fire continues to burn north of the Colleen River and west of Lois Creek.  Increase in acres reflects newer perimeter data.\"\n",
      "51,\"Resources are facing a very active fire while protecting a cabin and 2 allotments.  Eight smokejumpers have been placed on the eastern portion of the allotments and are planning to burn out the area either late tonight or in the morning. The remaining 8 smokejumpers are prepping the rest of the allotments with hose lay and plumbing.  Zone aircraft H-361EH assisted the fire with supplies and bucket drops while N864SF assisted the smokejumpers on the ground with aerial observations and updates of the fire activity.  Depending on the success of the burnout operations, the fire could be mopped up within a few days time.\"\n",
